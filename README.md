# License Plate Recognition using Computer Vision

##  Project Overview
This is an academic Computer Vision project focused on automatic vehicle license plate recognition.
The system detects license plates from images and recognizes the characters on the plate using deep learning techniques.

##  Objectives
- Detect vehicle license plates from images
- Recognize characters on license plates
- Apply computer vision and deep learning in a real-world problem

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PyTorch
- YOLO / CNN-based model
- Computer Vision techniques
